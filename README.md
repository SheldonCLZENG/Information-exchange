# Information exchange

We can use Linux's built-in mesg and write tools to send messages to other users.

Requirement: Implement a script to quickly send a message to a user, entering the user name as the first parameter, followed directly by the message to be sent. The script needs to detect whether the user is logged in to the system, whether the message function is enabled, and whether the current message is empty.
